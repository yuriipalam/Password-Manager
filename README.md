# Password Manager

The application is written in C++, with encryption module in Python. It allows us to store credentials and other sensitive data in a very secure way. The database is encrypted by AES-128 algorithm. Windows Forms are used for the interface. The app creates a database file, so it is possible to import it from any other devices later.

- .exe installer is available for Windows. Tested on Windows 10
